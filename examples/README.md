# Examples

This directory contains some examples demonstrating how the `Thread` class can
be used.

These examples are modified from cppreference.com's
[`std::thread`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread) entry
(licensed under CC-BY-SA). Since the `Thread` class is fully compatible with
`std::thread`, the execution results should be the same.
